Introduction to Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

Key Benefits:
- Cost Efficiency: Reduces capital expenditure on hardware and software
- Scalability: Resources can be scaled up or down based on demand
- Reliability: Built-in redundancy and backup systems
- Security: Enterprise-grade security measures and compliance
- Accessibility: Access from anywhere with internet connection

Cloud Service Models:
1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)  
3. Software as a Service (SaaS)
