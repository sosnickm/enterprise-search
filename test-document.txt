## Test Document for AI Search

This is a sample document for testing the AI-powered document search functionality.

### Project Overview
Our B3S Research Repository project integrates multiple data sources including:
- Atlassian Confluence pages
- Jira issues and tickets  
- Uploaded documents (PDF, Word, Excel, etc.)
- SharePoint files
- Monday.com project data

### Key Features
1. **Semantic Search** - Find documents by meaning, not just keywords
2. **Vector Embeddings** - Advanced AI understanding of document content
3. **Cross-Platform Integration** - Search across all your work tools
4. **Real-time Processing** - Instant text extraction and indexing

### Technical Implementation
The system uses:
- Vector databases for semantic similarity
- Large Language Models for content understanding
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for enhanced search
- Local file processing for privacy

### Use Cases
- Find project documents quickly
- Discover related content across platforms
- Search meeting notes and documentation
- Locate specific data in spreadsheets
- Access presentation slides and reports

### Benefits
- Saves time searching for information
- Improves team collaboration
- Reduces duplicate work
- Enables better knowledge sharing
- Provides unified search experience

This document can be used to test search queries like "project overview", "technical implementation", "vector databases", or "team collaboration".
