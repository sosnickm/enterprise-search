# PDF Text Extraction Guide

## How to Get the Best Results

### ‚úÖ PDFs That Work Well:
- Text-based PDFs created from Word, Google Docs, or similar
- PDFs with selectable text (you can highlight and copy text)
- Simple layouts without complex formatting
- Files under 10MB

### ‚ùå PDFs That May Not Work:
- Scanned documents (images of text)
- Password-protected PDFs
- Complex layouts with embedded graphics
- Very old PDF formats

### üîß If Your PDF Doesn't Extract Text:

1. **Test if it's text-based**: Try selecting and copying text from the PDF in a reader
2. **Convert scanned PDFs**: Use OCR tools like Adobe Acrobat, Google Drive, or online OCR services
3. **Save as new PDF**: Open in a PDF viewer and "Print to PDF" to create a cleaner version
4. **Alternative formats**: Convert to Word (.docx) or save as plain text (.txt)

### üìù Best Practices:
- Use searchable PDFs whenever possible
- Keep file sizes reasonable (under 10MB)
- Test extraction with a small sample first
- For bulk uploads, ensure consistent PDF quality
